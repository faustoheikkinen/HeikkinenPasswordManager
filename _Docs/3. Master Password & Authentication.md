## 3. Master Password & Authentication

Authentication mechanisms must provide robust security for Master Passwords while offering convenience features.

* **3.1 Master Password Never Stored in Plaintext:** The user's Master Password will never be stored in plain text anywhere (neither in config files nor environment variables).
* **3.2 Vault Encryption Key (VEK) Derivation:** The user's entered Master Password will be used with a strong **Key Derivation Function (KDF)** and a unique salt/iterations to derive the **Vault Encryption Key (VEK)**. This VEK is what directly encrypts and decrypts the vault file.
* **3.3 OS-Bound Encryption for VEK Storage:**
    * Users will have the *option* to securely store their VEK (not their Master Password itself) on the local computer.
    * This storage will leverage **OS-provided secure mechanisms** (e.g., Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI), macOS Keychain Services, Linux Secret Service API/Keyring).
    * Crucially, when storing the VEK, a **unique identifier for the specific App User Profile** will be integrated into the encryption context or metadata provided to the OS API. This ensures that the stored VEK can only be retrieved for that specific App User Profile, even when multiple profiles exist under a single shared OS login.
* **3.4 Automatic Vault Unlock at Launch (If VEK Stored):**
    * If a user has opted to store their VEK (via OS-bound encryption), and the OS-level decryption of the `encrypted_master_key_blob` is successful upon selecting their profile at app launch, their vault will be **automatically unlocked** without requiring manual Master Password entry.
    * This provides a seamless "auto-login" experience for the user.
* **3.5 Re-authentication After Auto-Lock:**
    * The application must include an **auto-lock feature** (with a configurable timeout) that clears sensitive keys from memory and locks the vault after a period of inactivity.
    * To unlock the vault after an auto-lock, the user **MUST re-authenticate**.
    * **Preferred Re-authentication Methods (for convenience):**
        * **OS-level PIN:** (e.g., Windows Hello PIN). If available and configured by the user, this allows quick re-authentication.
        * **Biometrics:** (e.g., Touch ID/Face ID on macOS, or integrated biometric hardware on Windows/Linux).
    * **Fallback Re-authentication:** If OS-level PIN/biometrics are not available, not configured, or if the user wishes to bypass them, the app must **always provide an option to manually enter the Master Password** for the active profile to unlock the vault.
* **3.6 Master Password Reset/Recovery:** If the stored encrypted VEK becomes invalid (e.g., OS change, corruption, admin reset), the application must prompt the user to re-enter their Master Password. This re-entry will then be used to derive a new VEK and securely store it again via the OS-bound method.
* **3.7 No Password Re-entry During Active Session:** Once a user's vault is open and active, they should be able to interact with it (view, edit, add entries) without needing to re-enter their Master Password until the app is closed, logs out, or auto-locks.
